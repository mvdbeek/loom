/**
 * Post-run job-status hint (#210).
 *
 * `galaxy_run_tool` / `galaxy_run_user_tool` return at job SUBMISSION -- the
 * "Started tool …" / HTTP 200 response means the job was queued, not that it
 * finished. A model (especially a low-capability one) reads that as success and
 * moves on, so a job that errors in Galaxy is never surfaced in chat until the
 * user explicitly asks. Unlike workflow invocations, single tool runs leave no
 * `loom-invocation` block, so the background poller never advances them either.
 *
 * Mirrors `confusables-hint.ts`: hook the tool-result message and append a
 * reminder that submission != success, so the agent verifies the job's terminal
 * state and reports failures in the same turn. This is a deterministic nudge --
 * it does not itself call Galaxy or resolve the job; it just keeps the model
 * from mistaking a 200 for a completed run.
